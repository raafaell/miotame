# kiota.me

[KIOTA.me](https://kiota.me/) is a decentralized IOTA Address Shortener. 

This tool uses the Tangle to retrieve data from an address and its tag. When a user inputs their address, kiota.me takes the checksum from the address (last 9 trytes) and uses it as a unique tag, a zero value transaction is then sent to the address owner thus giving kiota.me the ability to retrieve the address at a later time. The tag must be unique and match the addresses checksum.
